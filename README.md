# Serelude - Interactive Anniversary Animation
A quiet song between blossoms.
Each petal a note, each line of code a heartbeat.
What began as a prelude now blooms softly in light
a serenade that lingers, looping endlessly,
for love that grows in silence and glows in rhythm. 

This project is a two-month anniversary web animation. It is a static site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. It features an interactive 2D world with a controllable character, a dynamic day/night cycle, and other interactive elements. All visuals are procedurally drawn and animated using the HTML Canvas API.

## Interactive Features

You can interact with the animation using the following keyboard and mouse controls:

### Key Presses
*   **'a' / 'd'**: Move the character left and right.
*   **'w' / 'space'**: Make the character jump.
*   **'1' - '6'**: Select an item in the inventory bar.
*   **'t'**: Fades in the text messages: "Happy two months, my love" and "I love you".
*   **'h'**: Triggers a "heart shower," scattering a burst of hearts across the screen.

### Mouse Actions
*   **Click on the sky**: Places a stone block in the world.
*   **Click on the world**:
    *   If a tool (Axe, Pickaxe) is selected, you will mine the appropriate block (trees, stone, dirt).
    *   If a resource (Wood, Stone, etc.) is selected, you will place that block in an empty space.
*   **Click and drag the sun/moon**: Manually control the time of day, transitioning between dawn, midday, dusk, and night.
*   **Hover over the text**: After revealing the text with the 't' key, hovering over it will cause the text to glow with a soft pink shadow.
