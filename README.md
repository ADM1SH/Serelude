# Serelude - Interactive Anniversary Animation
A quiet song between blossoms.
Each petal a note, each line of code a heartbeat.
What began as a prelude now blooms softly in light
a serenade that lingers, looping endlessly,
for love that grows in silence and glows in rhythm. 

This project is a two-month anniversary web animation themed around the Lily of the Valley flower. It is a static site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. All visuals are procedurally drawn and animated using the HTML Canvas API.

## Interactive Features

You can interact with the animation using the following keyboard and mouse controls:

### Key Presses
*   **'t'**: Fades in the text messages: "Happy two months, my love" and "I love you".
*   **'f'**: Spawns a new Lily of the Valley flower at a random position on the ground.
*   **'h'**: Triggers a "heart shower," scattering a burst of hearts across the screen.
*   **'b'**: Toggles "bloom mode," which creates a continuous, gentle shower of falling pink petals.

### Mouse Actions
*   **Click**: A new Lily of the Valley will sprout from the ground at the horizontal position of your mouse click.
*   **Hover over a flower**: Moving your mouse near the top of a flower will cause a small burst of hearts to emanate from it.
*   **Hover over the text**: After revealing the text with the 't' key, hovering over it will cause the text to glow with a soft pink shadow.
