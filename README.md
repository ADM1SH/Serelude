# Serelude - Interactive Anniversary Animation
A quiet song between blossoms.
Each petal a note, each line of code a heartbeat.
What began as a prelude now blooms softly in light
a serenade that lingers, looping endlessly,
for love that grows in silence and glows in rhythm. 

This project, initially conceived as a two-month anniversary web animation, has evolved into an interactive 2D sandbox game. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a procedurally generated world where players can explore, build, and save their creations. The game features a controllable character, a dynamic day/night cycle, and all visuals are dynamically rendered using the HTML Canvas API. It's designed as a static site, easily hostable on platforms like GitHub Pages.

## Gameplay and Controls

You can interact with the game using the following keyboard and mouse controls:

### Key Presses
*   **'a' / 'd'**: Move the character left and right.
*   **'w' / 'space'**: Make the character jump.
*   **'1' - '6'**: Select an item in the inventory bar.
*   **'c'**: Show or hide the controls panel.
*   **'t'**: Fades in the text messages: "Happy two months, my love" and "I love you".

### Mouse Actions
*   **Click on the world**:
    *   Use the **Axe** to chop down trees and the **Pickaxe** to mine dirt and stone.
    *   Select any resource (Wood, Stone, etc.) to place it in the world. All items are unlimited for endless creativity!
*   **Click and drag the sun/moon**: Manually control the time of day, transitioning between dawn, midday, dusk, and night.
*   **Hover over the text**: After revealing the text with the 't' key, hovering over it will cause the text to glow with a soft pink shadow.
*   **Save / New World**: Use the buttons in the controls panel to save your current world to your browser, or to start a fresh new world.

A **minimap** in the top-right corner will help you navigate the world and see your creations from a distance.
